# 1. Business Problem

Description

---

Our Client is an early-stage e-commerce company selling various products from daily essentials (such as Dairy & vegetables) to high-end electronics and home appliances. It is a one-year-old company and they are witnessing many people coming to their platform and searching for products but only a few end up purchasing.

To increase the number of purchases, the business is planning to send discounts or coupons to users to motivate them to buy. But since it is an early-stage startup, they have only limited funds for this discount campaign. So, they have reached out to us seeking our help in building a model that would predict the purchase probability of each user in buying a product.

We will be making use of propensity modeling for this. Propensity modeling is a set of approaches to building predictive models to forecast the behavior of a target audience by analyzing their past behaviors. That is to say, propensity models help identify the likelihood of someone performing a certain action. We can then use this likelihood or probability score to create personalized targeting campaigns for the users thus reducing our total cost (targeting only a small set of users) and increasing our ROI.

To help us in predicting the propensity of purchase, we will also make use of RFM Modeling. RFM is a data-driven customer segmentation technique that allows marketers to make informed decisions. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because the frequency and monetary value affect a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

It empowers marketers to quickly identify and segment users into homogeneous groups and target them with differentiated and personalized marketing strategies. This in turn improves user engagement and retention. With the probability scores from propensity modeling, the marketing team can filter only those users who need the actual push (in terms of discounts or coupons) to make a purchase rather than sending coupons to users who would have bought the product anyway.

**Purpose:** To build a model to predict the purchase probability of each user in buying a product for an e-commerce company with the help of the propensity model.

**Strategy:** we used the CRISP-DS (Cross-Industry Process - Data Science) as the main project management methodology.
